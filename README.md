# Exercise_ML

There are two different ways to approch the machine learning (ML) exercises of this course:

## 1) If you want to work directly on-line you have to work on the "notebooks" following these instructions:

* Go on google colab and log with your google account (https://colab.research.google.com/)
* Open the Github option and set the connection following what is written in the following picture :

## 2) If you want to work on your laptop you have to install Python 3.7:
Below there are instructions for the standard install of Python > 3.7 for the course.

* Download the appropriate version of miniconda for your computing environment: https://conda.io/miniconda.html
* Follow the "quick install" instructions to install miniconda on your machine: https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html
* Once you have installed miniconda, we need to set up a conda environment for our work. (To learn more about conda virtual environments, consult their docs: https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) From the command line (note this is slightly different on a Windows machine), enter the following: **conda env create -f environment.yml**
* To activate the environment, this should be done prior to any work at the course, enter the following on the command line:  **conda activate OAR_ML_env**
* To exit the environment, type the following: **conda deactivate**

If you don't want to install Anaconda or python on your pc, you still can work on the notebooks:
* go on google colab and log with your google account
* open the Github option and set the connection with this repository (see the picture) :

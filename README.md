# Exercise_ML
material for the machine learning course at OAR

Below are instructions for the standard install of Python > 3.7 for the course.

* Download the appropriate version of miniconda for your computing environment: https://conda.io/miniconda.html
* Follow the "quick install" instructions to install miniconda on your machine: https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html
* Once you have installed miniconda, we need to set up a conda environment for our work. (To learn more about conda virtual environments, consult their docs: https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) From the command line (note this is slightly different on a Windows machine), enter the following: conda env create -f environment.yml
* To activate the environment, this should be done prior to any work at the DSFP, enter the following on the command line:  %> conda activate OAR_ML_env
